# Overview

In writing this program I attempt to learn some of the basics of the Erlang language. I start off with a program that takes in a date and will give you the day of the week that was on. It can go back to the year 1800. I do not suggest trying to write a program like this in Erlang. User input is not a friendly thing in Erlang, or at the very least I have not figured out how it works yet. I also had a couple other functions that use some basic Erlang programming skills that are useful to know. There is a link, in the useful websites section, to a very helpful Youtube video that I used to learn a lot of what I did.

# Future Work

* It would be cool if the month that was selected was printed out to the user.
* I would like to learn more about guards.
* I would also like to better understand the "fun()" function.
